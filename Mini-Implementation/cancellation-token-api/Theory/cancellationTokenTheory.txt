What is CancellationToken in .NET?
.NET uses Cancellation Token for cooperative cancellation of asynchronous 
or long-running synchronous operations.

Propagates notification that operations should be canceled.

Cancellation tokens are particularly useful when long-running or asynchronous 
operations must be canceled under certain conditions, such as in UI applications 
where a user might decide to cancel an ongoing operation.
They allow for a cooperative approach to cancellation, where the executing code 
periodically checks for cancellation requests and responds accordingly.
