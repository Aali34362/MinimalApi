IServiceCollection :
IServiceCollection is a central part of the ASP.NET Core and .NET Core dependency injection system. 
It's a collection of service descriptors that are used to configure the dependency injection container. 
Here's what it's used for:

Service Registration: 
It's used to register services with the dependency injection container. 
Services can be registered with various lifetimes such as transient, scoped, or singleton.

Service Resolution: 
It's used to resolve services from the dependency injection container. Once services are registered, 
they can be requested and injected into application components like controllers, middleware, or other services.

Configuration: 
It's used to configure services and their dependencies within the application. 
This includes setting up dependencies, specifying lifetimes, and configuring options.

E.G : 
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Register services with IServiceCollection
    services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
    services.AddScoped<IOtherService, OtherService>();
    services.AddSingleton<IMySingletonService, MySingletonService>();

    // Configure options
    services.Configure<MyOptions>(Configuration.GetSection("MyOptions"));

    // Add MVC services
    services.AddControllers();
}

services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>() 
registers MyService as a transient service, meaning a new instance will be created every time it's requested.

services.AddScoped<IOtherService, OtherService>() 
registers OtherService as a scoped service, meaning a single instance will be created per scope (typically per HTTP request).

services.AddSingleton<IMySingletonService, MySingletonService>() 
registers MySingletonService as a singleton service, meaning a single instance will be created for the lifetime of the application.

services.Configure<MyOptions>(Configuration.GetSection("MyOptions")) 
registers configuration options.

services.AddControllers() 
registers services required for MVC controllers.

IServiceCollection is an essential part of configuring services and dependencies within ASP.NET Core applications, 
allowing for a flexible and maintainable application structure.
IServiceCollection is an interface provided by the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection namespace 
that is used to define a container for managing dependencies in an application. 



Services can be registered with or without implementation types: 
When you register a service with the dependency injection container, 
you specify the service type (the interface or abstract class that defines the service) 
and optionally the implementation type (the concrete class that provides the service). 
You can register a service without specifying an implementation type 
if you intend to use it with factory methods, delegates, or instances created elsewhere.

For example:

// Register with implementation type
services.AddTransient<IService, ServiceImplementation>();

// Register without implementation type
services.AddSingleton<IService>(serviceProvider => new ServiceImplementation());


Easily resolved using constructor injection or property injection: 
Once services are registered, they can be resolved and injected into other classes 
(typically controllers, services, or middleware) that depend on them. 
Dependency injection can be performed using constructor injection or property injection.

Constructor Injection: 
Dependencies are injected into the constructor of the consuming class. 
This is the preferred method as it ensures that dependencies are available when the class is instantiated.

public class MyClass
{
    private readonly IService _service;

    public MyClass(IService service)
    {
        _service = service;
    }
}

Property Injection: 
Dependencies are injected into public properties of the consuming class. 
While this approach is less preferred than constructor injection, it can be useful in certain scenarios.

public class MyClass
{
    public IService Service { get; set; }
}
With dependency injection, the framework handles the resolution and injection of dependencies, 
making it easy to manage and decouple components within your application.





{
so actually what happens when we are writing this piece of code
from my understanding is  
IService services = new ServiceImplementation();
basically we are creating object and passing the reference 
we write manually in each class so instead of writing in each class we are using three registers transient,scoped, singleton 
this all this is done in one services.AddTransient<IService, ServiceImplementation>(); in this code

Interface and Implementation: 
IService is an interface, and ServiceImplementation is a concrete class that implements this interface. 
In software engineering, it's often a good practice to program to an interface rather than a concrete implementation. 
This allows for flexibility, easy swapping of implementations, and easier testing (through the use of mock implementations).

Object Creation and Reference: 
When you write IService service = new ServiceImplementation();, 
you are indeed creating an object of type ServiceImplementation and assigning it to a variable of type IService. 
This is possible because ServiceImplementation implements IService, so it can be treated as an IService. 
This is a form of polymorphism in object-oriented programming.

Dependency Injection: 
Instead of manually creating instances of ServiceImplementation and assigning them to variables, you can use dependency injection. 
Dependency injection frameworks, like the one provided by ASP.NET Core, 
manage the creation and lifetime of objects for you.
When you register ServiceImplementation as a service (services.AddTransient<IService, ServiceImplementation>();), 
you're telling the framework to create instances of ServiceImplementation whenever an IService is required. 
Later, when you request an instance of IService, 
the framework automatically resolves it to an instance of ServiceImplementation and provides it to you. 
This process is typically performed using constructor injection.

Transient, Scoped, Singleton: 
These are different lifetimes that you can specify when registering a service.

Transient: 
A new instance is created every time the service is requested. It's suitable for lightweight, stateless services.

Scoped: A single instance is created per scope. In ASP.NET Core, a scope typically corresponds to an HTTP request. This means that within the same HTTP request, the same instance is returned for subsequent requests for the same service.
Singleton: A single instance is created for the lifetime of the application. This instance is shared across all consumers. It's suitable for stateful services or services that are expensive to create.
So, in summary, by using dependency injection and service registration, you're abstracting away the creation and management of objects, allowing the framework to handle it for you based on the configuration you provide. This promotes decoupling, flexibility, and easier testing in your application.

IConfiguration :
IConfiguration is a key component in ASP.NET Core for accessing configuration settings in an application. 
It's used to read configuration data from various sources such as JSON files, 
environment variables, command-line arguments, and more. Here's how it works:

Configuration Providers: IConfiguration is built on top of a configuration system that uses configuration providers to load configuration data. Providers are responsible for retrieving configuration data from various sources.

Configuration Sources: Configuration providers can load data from different sources such as JSON files, XML files, environment variables, command-line arguments, Azure Key Vault, and more. Each provider adds its configuration data to the configuration system.

Configuration Hierarchy: Configuration data is organized into a hierarchical structure where data from different sources can override each other based on a set of rules. This allows for flexible and customizable configuration settings.

Binding: IConfiguration provides methods to bind configuration data to strongly-typed objects. This simplifies accessing configuration settings and allows for type-safe access to configuration values.

Here's a simple example of how IConfiguration is used in an ASP.NET Core application:

public class Startup
{
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Access configuration settings
        var connectionString = Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");

        // Bind configuration to strongly-typed object
        var myOptions = Configuration.GetSection("MyOptions").Get<MyOptions>();

        // Register services
        services.AddDbContext<MyDbContext>(options =>
            options.UseSqlServer(connectionString));
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        // Configure middleware
    }
}
In this example:

Startup class constructor accepts an instance of IConfiguration.
Inside ConfigureServices, configuration settings are accessed using methods like GetConnectionString and GetSection.
Configuration data can be bound to strongly-typed objects using Get<T>.
Configuration settings can be used to configure services, middleware, and other components in the application.
IConfiguration provides a powerful and flexible way to manage configuration settings in ASP.NET Core applications, allowing developers to externalize and customize application settings easily.
