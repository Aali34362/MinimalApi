EnsureDatabase: This is likely a class or method provided by the database migration library. 
It's used to ensure that the target database is in the expected state before performing any database operations.

For: This method or property specifies the type of database that is being targeted. 
In this case, it's likely followed by .SqlDatabase(connectionString), 
where connectionString is a variable containing the connection string to the target SQL Server database.

SqlDatabase(connectionString): This method or property specifies the connection string for the target SQL Server database. 
The connection string contains information such as the server name, database name, authentication credentials, etc., 
needed to establish a connection to the database.

Overall, this code snippet is configuring the database migration library to ensure that a specific SQL Server database, 
identified by the provided connection string, is ready for use. It's likely checking for the existence of the database, 
its schema version, or other prerequisites before proceeding with any database operations.

DeployChanges: This is likely a class or method provided by the database migration library. 
It serves as the starting point for defining database upgrade operations.

To: This is a method or property used to specify the target database to which the changes will be applied. 
In this case, it's likely followed by .SqlDatabase(connectionString), 
where connectionString is a variable containing the connection string to the target database.

LogToConsole(): This method or property configures logging for the database upgrade process. 
It may log messages, warnings, errors, or other relevant information to the console during the upgrade process.

WithScriptsFromFileSystem("Scripts"): This method or property specifies the source of database upgrade scripts. 
In this case, it's likely reading SQL scripts from a folder named "Scripts" in the file system. 
These scripts contain the SQL commands necessary to perform database schema changes.

Build(): This method is typically used to finalize the configuration and prepare the database upgrade process to be executed.

var result = upgrader.PerformUpgrade(): This line executes the database upgrade process using the configured settings and scripts. 
It likely returns a result object containing information about the upgrade process, such as success or failure status, 
the number of scripts applied, any errors encountered, etc.

Overall, this code snippet is configuring and executing database schema migrations or updates
using a library or framework that provides a fluent API for defining upgrade operations, specifying the target database, 
logging configuration, script sources, and executing the upgrade process.
